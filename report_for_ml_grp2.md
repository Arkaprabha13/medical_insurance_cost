 üè¶ Bank Loan Default Predictor

 üìö Overview

The **Bank Loan Default Predictor** is a machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. The project uses deep learning models, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), to analyze borrower details and loan information for smarter lending decisions.

This repository contains the code, model training, and evaluation results for loan default prediction, aimed at assisting financial institutions in making better, data-driven lending decisions.
